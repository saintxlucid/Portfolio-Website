# Lucid Portfolio

## Project Overview

A modern, immersive portfolio website showcasing creative work across multiple disciplines with emphasis on smooth animations, 3D elements, and responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- @react-three/fiber

## Design Philosophy

The portfolio was designed with the following principles:
- **Minimal yet impactful**: Clean design that lets the work speak for itself
- **Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance-focused**: Lazy loading, code splitting, and optimized assets
- **Responsive**: Seamless experience across all device sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Animation Strategy
Using Framer Motion for declarative animations with proper prefers-reduced-motion support ensures smooth performance and accessibility.

### 3D Integration
The hero section features a custom 3D sigil created with Three.js that's lazy-loaded to maintain optimal page load performance.

### Dark Theme
A carefully crafted dark color palette that reduces eye strain while maintaining excellent contrast ratios for readability.

### Component Architecture
Modular component structure makes it easy to update and maintain individual sections without affecting the entire application.
