# Ethereal Soundscapes

## Project Overview

Ethereal Soundscapes is an interactive audio-visual experience that combines generative music with real-time 3D visuals, creating an immersive environment where sound and visual elements respond to user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Three.js
- Web Audio API
- GLSL Shaders

## Key Features

### Interactive Audio Engine
The project features a custom-built audio engine using the Web Audio API that generates ambient soundscapes in real-time based on user input and environmental parameters.

### Real-time 3D Visualization
Utilizing Three.js and custom GLSL shaders, the visual component responds to audio frequencies and creates a mesmerizing display of particles and geometric forms.

### Responsive Design
The experience adapts seamlessly across devices, maintaining performance and visual quality on both desktop and mobile platforms.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Performance Optimization
One of the main challenges was maintaining smooth 60fps performance while processing both audio and complex 3D rendering. This was solved through:
- Implementing Web Workers for audio processing
- Optimizing shader code
- Using instanced rendering for particles

### Cross-browser Compatibility
Ensuring consistent audio behavior across different browsers required careful handling of the Web Audio API and fallbacks for older browsers.

## Outcomes

The project has been featured in several digital art showcases and has received positive feedback from the creative coding community.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with MIDI controllers
- Recording and playback functionality
- Social sharing features
- VR support
