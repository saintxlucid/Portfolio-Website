# Neural Canvas

## Project Overview

Neural Canvas is a creative tool that transforms user input into generative art using machine learning, bridging the gap between traditional art and AI-assisted creativity.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- React
- Canvas API

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Generation
Using a custom-trained neural network, the tool can interpret sketches, text prompts, and color palettes to generate unique artwork.

### Real-time Preview
Users can see their creations evolve in real-time as they adjust parameters and refine their input.

### Export Options
Multiple export formats including high-resolution PNG, SVG, and even video animations of the generation process.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Model Architecture
The project uses a modified StyleGAN architecture trained on a curated dataset of digital art and illustrations.

### Frontend Integration
React provides an intuitive interface for parameter adjustment, while the Canvas API handles real-time rendering and preview.

### Backend Processing
Python/Flask backend handles model inference and image processing tasks.

## Impact

Neural Canvas has been used by digital artists and designers to:
- Create unique social media content
- Generate design inspiration
- Explore new artistic styles

## Lessons Learned

Working at the intersection of art and technology requires careful balance between creative freedom and technical constraints.

## Next Steps

- Mobile app development
- Community gallery feature
- Additional model architectures
- Collaborative creation tools
